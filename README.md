## Overview

The Datadog extension packs several features including:

- [**Code Insights**](#code-insights) to keep you informed about

  - Issues from [Error Tracking][error_tracking]
  - Reports by [Application Vulnerability Management][vulnerability_management]
  - [Flaky tests][flaky_test_management] detected by CI Visibility

- [**Synthetic Tests**](#synthetic-tests) to provide quality assurance during development by allowing you to run existing Synthetic Tests against local servers.

- [**View in VS Code**](#view-in-vs-code) to directly go from file references on the Datadog platform to your source files.

- [**Logs Navigation**](#logs-navigation) to allow you to search for logs from your code.

- [**Code Delta**](#code-delta) to more accurately map observability data to your files in VS Code.

- [**Static Analysis**](#static-analysis) to detect and fix problems even before you commit changes.

## Requirements

- **A Datadog account**: Most features require a Datadog account. If you're new to Datadog, go to the [Datadog website][datadog] to learn more about Datadog's observability tools and sign up for a free trial.

- **VS Code Git**: The extension works better when VS Code Git integration is enabled. You can ensure that the integration is enabled by checking the `git.enabled` setting.

## Code Insights

The **Code Insights** tree displays insights generated by the Datadog platform that are relevant to your code-base. The Code Insights can be grouped by category, kind, priority, and file.

<video src="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-for-vscode/raw/main/assets/code_insights.mp4" controls title="Datadog Code Insights"></video>

Code Insights include a detailed description for each issue, and links to:

- The related source code location
- The Datadog platform for additional information

You can dismiss individual Code Insights and set filters to view the ones you are most interested in.

## Synthetic Tests

The Datadog extension enables you to [run Synthetic HTTP tests and browser tests on local environments][synthetics_tunnel] directly in VS Code. You can identify and address potential issues resulting from code changes before they are deployed into production and impact your end users.

> We support [HTTP API tests][api_tests] and [Browser tests][browser_tests].

</center>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

### Run Synthetic tests locally

1. Select a Synthetic test to execute. You can search for specific tests by clicking the **Search** icon.
2. Change the test's configuration to convert the start URL and specify a `localhost` URL on the **Settings** page.
3. Run the test.

</center>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

If you haven't set up Synthetic tests already, [create a test in Datadog][synthetics_create]. For more information about running tests on a local environment, see [Getting Started with API Tests][synthetics_started], [Getting Started with Browser Tests][synthetics_browser], and the [Continuous Testing Tunnel documentation][synthetics_tunnel].

### Permissions

By default, only users with the [Datadog Admin and Datadog Standard roles][datadog_default_roles] can create, edit, and delete Synthetic HTTP and browser tests. To get create, edit, and delete access to Synthetic HTTP and browser tests, upgrade your user to one of those two [default roles][datadog_default_roles].

If you are using the [custom role feature][datadog_custom_roles], add your user to any custom role that includes `synthetics_read` and `synthetics_write` permissions.

## View in VS Code

The **View in VS Code** feature provides a link from Datadog directly to your source files. Look for the button next to frames in stack traces displayed in the UI (for example, in [Error Tracking][error_tracking]):

</center>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

> To use this feature, first configure [source code integration][source_code_integration] for your service.

## Logs navigation

You can navigate to the [Log Explorer][log_explorer] on the [Datadog platform][datadog] directly from your source code files.

If you're using a supported logging library, the extension is able to show you code lenses on the lines where it has detected log patterns that match the Datadog platform records:

<video src="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-for-vscode/raw/main/assets/logs_navigation.mp4" controls title="Datadog Logs Navigation Demo"></video>

The currently supported logging libraries are:

- JavaScript
  - [@datadog/browser-logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/javascript/)
  - [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
  - [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)
  - [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
  - [Log4js](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-node)
- Python
  - [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)

Alternatively, you can select some text in your source code, right click on them, and look for the **Datadog > Search Logs With Selected Text** option.

## Code Delta

Code Delta matches the line numbers included in Datadog telemetry to the line numbers of the files you are currently working on in VS Code.

For example, all [View in VS Code](#view-in-vs-code) links on the Datadog platform encode runtime version info, and the extension uses that to compute the corresponding line of code in your editor, taking into account version changes.

You can tweak the Code Delta settings to change how the matching algorithm works. In particular, you can modify the `Minimum Affinity` value, which determines the degree of confidence required to match lines.

## Static Analysis

The [Static Analysis][static_analysis] integration analyzes your code (locally) against predefined rules to detect and fix problems.

The Datadog extension runs [Static Analysis][static_analysis] rules on your source files as you edit them. The goal is to detect and fix problems such as maintainability issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in your code before you commit your changes.

[Static Analysis][static_analysis] supports scanning for many programming languages. For a complete list, see [Static Analysis Rules][static_analysis_rules]. For file types belonging to supported languages, issues are shown in the source code editor, and suggested fixes can be applied directly.

<video src="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-for-vscode/raw/main/assets/static_analysis.mp4" controls title="Datadog Static Analysis Demo"></video>

### Getting started

When you start editing a source file, the extension checks for [static-analysis.datadog.yml][static_analysis_config_file] at your source repository's root. It prompts you to create it if necessary.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
<center>
<br/>
<div><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-for-vscode/c743ed36e3a81ed2d4bf8bdb44e0909461796b26/assets/images/readme/static-analysis-onboard.png" alt="Static Analysis onboarding message."/></div>
</center>
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

Once the configuration file is created, the static analyzer runs automatically in the background whenever a file is opened. You can also run a batch analysis for individual folders and even the entire workspace:

<video src="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-for-vscode/raw/main/assets/static_analysis_batch_analysis.mp4" controls title="Datadog Static Analysis Demo"></video>

> The Static Analysis feature does not require a [Datadog][datadog] account, as source files are analyzed locally.

## License
