The [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) VS Code extension helps bring the power of Synthetic tests to your local environment. Now you can run Synthetic HTTP API and Browser tests against your local code and no longer need to wait for CI/CD runs. With this reduced feedback loop, developers can be better assured of the impact their code changes will have on their applications.

> **DISCLAIMER**
>
> This is a **Public Beta** version of the Datadog extension, intended for Datadog customers that use the [Synthetic Tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/). We currently only support [HTTP API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/http_tests/?tab=requestoptions) and [Browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests/?tab=requestoptions).
